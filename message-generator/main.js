Think of hard times like bad weather, they will pass.
Make the most of less.
By the time you're eighty years old you've learned everything. You only have
  to remember it.
The man who is too old to learn was probably always too old to learn.
The best people are the good old wrinkled people with a sparkle in their eye, a
  wink when you walk by or a toothless smile saying you are doing just fine.
Beautiful young people are accidents of nature, but beautiful old people are
  works of art.
If I'd known I was going to live this long, I'd have taken better care of
  myself.
Being a senior doesn't automatically make one wise but the wise & foolish alike
  have things to teach us.
We are never old with the strength of the spirit, although the body may fail.
Gray hair is a crown of splendor.
The oldest trees often bear the sweetest fruit.
Too many people, when they get old, think that they have to live by the
  calendar.
To be seventy years young is sometimes far more cheerful and hopeful than to be
  forty years old.
What you do today will determine your future.
You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.
The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which
  means never losing your enthusiasm.
You can’t help getting older, but you don’t have to get old.
None are so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm.
It’s amazing how a little tomorrow can make up for a whole lot of yesterday.
The great thing about getting older is that you don’t lose all the other ages
  you’ve been.
The excitement of learning separates youth from old age. As long as you're
  learning you're not old.
Change your life today. Don’t gamble on the future, act now, without delay.
One person’s craziness is another person’s reality.
The past cannot be changed. The future is yet in your power.
The longer you look back, the farther you can look forward.
